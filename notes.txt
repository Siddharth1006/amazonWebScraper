1. Create package.json 
$ npm init -y <Enter>

2.Created init file
$ git init 

3. Now create a new repository in your github account.
Once done adding README.md , LICENSE etc.. stuff. Assuming you added some data to README or added an extra file in the remote repo.
But now you don't have all that in you remote repo. So, what to do?
You pull that data to remote repo.

"main" - is the MAIN branch name! NOT master! 
Using both will create multiple branch names which will later cause a problem!

S1: Set remote repo: $ git remote add origin <REMOTE_REPO_URL>
S2: Pull changes: git pull origin <branchname> --allow-unrelated-histories //makes sure all unrelated histories are also allowed
S3: Now you can git add . , git commit -m "" and git push

Err : "There is no tracking information for the current branch"
    You could specify what branch you want to pull:
        #git pull origin main
    (OR)
    You could set it up so that your local main branch tracks github main branch as an upstream:
        $git branch -u origin/main (if STILL in main branch)
        $git branch -u origin/main main (if checked out of MAIN branch)
        $git pull    

NOW TO MAKE SURE WE push all changes to "main" branch, simply 
    Option1: Delete master branch if there exists (AFTER PULLING those changes to main branch)
        #To delete a branch without merging
        $ git branch -D <branchname>

        #To delete a branch after merging (branchname can be master , or whatever)
        $ git branch -d <branchname>

        //We Haave deleted the branch locally. Now, we HAVE TO PUSH Those CHANGES to remote repo.
        //So that there also the <branch> doesn't exit!
        $ git push -d origin main

    Option2: Do the following: https://stevenmortimer.com/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/


3) $ npm install express nodemon request-promise
express = backend framework for node.js
request-promise - need for making API requests
nodemon - reloads the terminal every time we make edits to code

To run request-promise , we need request as well
$ npm install request 

What is Scraper API?
Scraper API = Allows us to scrape HTML from any website and turn it into useful json information.
https://www.scraperapi.com/ => Visit the website.
(ALREADY have an account via GITHUB!!)

After logging in, copy the API key.
Keep it safe and don't let any one access it.
Best Solution to the problem : .env file!

$ npm install dotenv --save

Add the following in index.js
const dotenv = require("dotenv");
dotenv.config(); // Trying to connect to the .env file 

Now, we can use process.env.<KEY> or whatever we need to.


app.get() vs router.get()?

//BRILLIANT EXPLANATION!


NOTE - Instead of using baseUrl and my personal API key, we need users to use their own API key. So, we make a dynamic base URl and
remove our API key from .env cuz now we will getting/passing it as a paramter from req.query when we are sending a request.
